# Proposals Table Update Summary

## Overview
Updated the proposals table at `http://localhost:3000/zphere-admin/proposals` with customer filter repositioning and three new customer-related columns.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. **Customer Column Updates**
- ✅ Removed duplicate Customer column that was at the end
- ✅ Added filter button to the existing Customer column (now at position 2)
- ✅ Filter functionality allows filtering proposals by customer

### 2. **New Columns Added**

#### **Invoice Due Column**
- **Position**: After Valid Until column
- **Purpose**: Shows pending invoice amount for the customer
- **Calculation**: Sums up all unpaid/partially paid invoices for the customer
- **Display**: Currency format (USD) or '-' if no data
- **API**: Fetches from `/invoices/?customer_id={id}`

#### **Projects Column**
- **Position**: After Invoice Due column
- **Purpose**: Shows number of projects associated with the customer
- **Calculation**: Counts projects for the customer
- **Display**: Number count or '-' if no data
- **API**: Fetches from `/projects/?customer_id={id}`

#### **Total Proposals Column**
- **Position**: After Projects column
- **Purpose**: Shows total number of proposals for the customer
- **Calculation**: Counts all proposals (including current one) for the customer
- **Display**: Number count or '-' if no data
- **Source**: Counted from loaded proposals data

### 3. **State Management**
Added new state to store customer-related data:
```typescript
customerData: Record<string, {
  invoiceDue: number;      // In cents
  projectsCount: number;
  totalProposals: number;
}>
```

### 4. **API Integration**
Created `fetchCustomerData()` function that:
- Extracts unique customer IDs from loaded proposals
- For each customer, fetches:
  - Pending invoices (filters by payment_status != 'PAID')
  - Projects count
  - Proposal count (from local data)
- Handles API errors gracefully (shows 0 or '-' on failure)
- Runs automatically when proposals are loaded

## Table Structure

### Column Order (Left to Right):
1. **Proposal** - Proposal number
2. **Customer** - Customer name (with filter button)
3. **Title** - Proposal title (inline editable)
4. **Amount** - Proposal amount (inline editable)
5. **Status** - Proposal status (inline editable, filterable)
6. **Created Date** - Date created (filterable)
7. **Valid Until** - Expiry date (inline editable, filterable)
8. **Invoice Due** - Pending invoice amount (NEW)
9. **Projects** - Number of projects (NEW)
10. **Total Proposals** - Total proposals count (NEW)
11. **Actions** - Action buttons

## Technical Implementation

### Data Fetching Flow
```
1. Page loads → fetchProposals()
2. Proposals loaded → useEffect triggers
3. fetchCustomerData() runs
4. For each unique customer:
   - Fetch invoices → calculate invoiceDue
   - Fetch projects → count projectsCount
   - Count proposals → totalProposals
5. setCustomerData() updates state
6. Table re-renders with new data
```

### Error Handling
- API errors are caught and logged
- Failed requests default to 0 for counts
- Missing data shows as '-' in the table
- Non-blocking: page remains functional even if some data fails to load

### Performance Considerations
- Fetches data for unique customers only (no duplicates)
- Uses Promise.all for parallel API calls
- Caches data in state to avoid re-fetching
- Re-fetches when proposals change

## Filter Behavior

### Customer Filter
- Located in the Customer column header
- Shows checkboxes for all customers
- Multi-select capability
- Filter persists until cleared or page refresh
- Works in combination with other filters

## Display Format

### Invoice Due
- Shows: `$1,234.56` format
- Shows `-` if no pending invoices
- Calculated from unpaid + partially paid invoices
- Amount in cents converted to dollars for display

### Projects
- Shows: `5` (numeric count)
- Shows `-` if no projects
- Counts all projects for the customer

### Total Proposals
- Shows: `3` (numeric count)
- Shows `-` if no proposals (edge case)
- Includes current proposal in count

## Files Modified

```
src/pages/Proposals/ProposalsPage.tsx
```

**Key Changes:**
- Added customerData state (line ~175)
- Added fetchCustomerData function (line ~277)
- Added useEffect to trigger data fetching (line ~189)
- Updated Customer column header with filter button (line ~1220)
- Removed duplicate Customer column from end
- Added 3 new column headers (line ~1318-1325)
- Added 3 new data cells (line ~1394-1403)
- Updated colspan from 9 to 11 (line ~1402)
- Fixed top bar date filter z-index to 99999 (line ~1247)

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Tests
- [ ] Customer filter button appears in Customer column header
- [ ] Customer filter opens popup with checkbox list
- [ ] Selecting customers filters proposals correctly
- [ ] Invoice Due column shows correct pending amount
- [ ] Projects column shows correct count
- [ ] Total Proposals column shows correct count
- [ ] Data refreshes when proposals change
- [ ] '-' displays when data is unavailable

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Customer with no invoices shows $0.00 or '-'
- [ ] Customer with no projects shows '0' or '-'
- [ ] Customer with only 1 proposal shows '1'
- [ ] API errors don't crash the page
- [ ] Multiple API failures handled gracefully

### UI/UX
- [ ] Columns aligned properly
- [ ] Currency format displays correctly
- [ ] Filter popup positions correctly
- [ ] Table scrolls horizontally if needed
- [ ] Responsive on different screen sizes

### Performance
- [ ] Page loads without noticeable delay
- [ ] Data fetching doesn't block UI
- [ ] No duplicate API calls
- [ ] Parallel fetching works efficiently

## Known Limitations

1. **Initial Load**: Customer data fetches after proposals load (slight delay)
2. **Real-time Updates**: Data doesn't auto-refresh (requires manual refresh)
3. **API Dependency**: Requires invoices and projects endpoints to exist
4. **Error Display**: Failed API calls show '-' or '0' (no error indicator)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Loading Indicators**: Show spinner while fetching customer data
2. **Tooltips**: Add tooltips explaining what each column shows
3. **Click-through**: Make counts clickable to navigate to invoices/projects
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket or polling for live data
5. **Caching**: Cache customer data to reduce API calls
6. **Sorting**: Allow sorting by new columns
7. **Export**: Include new columns in CSV/Excel export

### Nice to Have
- Color coding for invoice due (red for overdue)
- Project status indicators
- Proposal win rate per customer
- Customer lifetime value
- Last interaction date

## API Endpoints Used

```
GET /proposals/                      - List all proposals
GET /customers/                      - List all customers
GET /invoices/?customer_id={id}     - Get invoices for customer
GET /projects/?customer_id={id}     - Get projects for customer
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Columns show '-' for all rows
**Solution**: Check browser console for API errors, verify endpoints exist

### Issue: Customer filter doesn't appear
**Solution**: Clear browser cache, check FunnelIcon import

### Issue: Data doesn't update
**Solution**: Check useEffect dependency array, verify proposals are loading

### Issue: Wrong data displayed
**Solution**: Check customer_id mapping, verify API response format

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# View in browser
open http://localhost:3000/zphere-admin/proposals
