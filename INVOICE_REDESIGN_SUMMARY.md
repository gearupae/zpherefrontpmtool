- `GET /invoices/:id/pdf` - Download invoice PDF

### New (Need Backend Implementation):

## 📝 Backend TODO

To fully support the payment functionality, implement these backend endpoints:

### 1. Record Payment Endpoint
```
POST /api/invoices/:id/payments
Body: {
  amount: number (cents),
  payment_method: string,
  payment_date: ISO date string,
  reference_number?: string
}
Response: { success: boolean, payment_id: string }
```

### 2. Payment Receipt PDF Endpoint
```
GET /api/invoices/:id/payment-receipt
Query Params:
  - payment_amount: number (cents)
  - payment_method: string
  - payment_date: string
  - reference_number: string
Response: PDF blob
```

The PDF should include:
- Invoice details (number, date, amount)
- Payment details (amount, method, date, reference)
- Customer information
- Company/sender information
- Payment confirmation/receipt number

## 🎯 Result

The invoice table now:
1. ✅ Matches projects table design exactly
2. ✅ Has all search, filter, sort, and inline edit features
3. ✅ Shows customer invoice statistics (Total & Unpaid)
4. ✅ Enables payment recording with receipt generation
5. ✅ Uses proper z-index for all popups (no overlap issues)
6. ✅ Maintains consistent UX across the application

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test all functionality in the browser
2. Implement backend payment endpoints
3. Test payment flow end-to-end
4. Verify PDF generation works correctly
5. Add any additional business logic as needed
